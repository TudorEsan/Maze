# Maze
A maze solver made with python. You can solve the maze using lee algorithm or by using A*.

This app shows how this two algorithms work. 
(Each jump to left, right, top, bottom, or any of the diagonals has the same distance)

## How to use it?
1. start it with: "python start_app.py"
2. choose the start and finish points, and create some walls
3. start one algorithm or both at the same time
